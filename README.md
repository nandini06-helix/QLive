# QLive

A real-time question posting web application built with the **MERN stack** and **WebSockets**. This platform is designed to enhance interaction during live sessions like workshops, speaker events, webinars, or classroom lectures—especially in scenarios where audience size makes it difficult for every question to be heard.
